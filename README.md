### Title and Personal Headline

Curious Scientist Turned Curious Developer

### Personal Pitch

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Jacob Bassett and I am a full-stack software developer based in Seattle Washington. Before I became a developer I was a molecular biologist studying how proteins control gene expression. As a biologist, most of my time was spent in the lab working directly with DNA, RNA, and proteins. But often I would bump into a computational problem that needed some custom software. As I learned to develop these small-personal programs I became more and more drawn to programming and would want to spend the whole day playing around with code. Eventually I decided to make the switch and develop full time. Here is a little taste of what I have worked on during my journey. Please explore my projects and leave a comment!

### Excites me about tech?

I'm motivated by the reach of the software I can develop. I spent so much of my past career using others applications, to the point that their software was indespensable to my work. I want to build software like that. Tools that people cannot perform their work without.
